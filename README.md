How it works: 

Our program has many functions. GetMatrixColumns and GetMatrixRows are in charge of creating the Rows and Columns for Connect4. Initial State takes in an initializing string, and produces a state. Counter is used as a helper for legal moves. Legal Moves is a procedure that creates a list of all the legal moves at a given state. We used transpose features to transpose the matrix for the diagonal and horizontal features. Game stays is used to check the status of the game. Add token to Column is used to input tokens to the columns of the board. New Matrix with Token is used to created a new matrix with the added tokens. Add zeros is used to add zeros to the diagonal matrices. Vert Four in a row is used to check to see if a player has gotten a vertical four in a row. Horizontal four in a row is used to check to see if a player has gotten a horizontal four in a row. Then, we created two procedures to check to see if see if a player has a diagonal four in a row. Next state is used to produces the state that results from making a move. String of player is a procedure that returns the string of player. Then estimate value takes in many helpers that estimate the point system of the game. Whenever Player 1 is more likely to win than estimate value produced a float with a higher value. All these procedure fit together to create a partial functioning Connect4 game
